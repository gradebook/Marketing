# Release Notes

## 3.11 (July 4, 2020 ðŸŽ‡)

### Features

 - Based on your feedback, we've added a toggle to let you choose between entering points-based grades (18/20) and percentage grades (90%). ([blog post](/blog/toggle-percentages-or-points))

 - The app now goes to sleep after you've been gone for a while

### Bug Fixes / Notable Changes

 - Unified iconography

 - `Your Semesters` page has a new look, and now lists semesters reverse chronologically (newest semester first)

 - Remove empty (no name or weight) categories before sharing a course

 - Internal improvements. This should reduce the number of bugs you see and help us make changes faster!
